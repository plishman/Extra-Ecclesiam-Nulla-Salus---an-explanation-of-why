# Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus

## Why?

Because the only way to get into Heaven is to follow the example of Christ, which shows the life cycle of the human creature in full (for being in Heaven is the true adult stage of human life).

But part of the example of Christ is to love our neighbour as ourselves. BUT Christ is *also* one of our neighbours. So part of following Him is also loving Him.

Christ was baptised, so to follow Him in His example of the life cycle of a human creature that survives into adulthood is also to be baptised.

To love Christ as our neighbour and also to be baptised in emulation of His example is to be within the Church.

Hence, outside the Church there is no salvation.
